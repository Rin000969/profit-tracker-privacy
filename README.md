Thank you for using Profit Tracker.
Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information the app collects, how it is used, and how it is protected.

1. Information We Do Not Collect

We do not have access to your appointments, services, revenue information, or any other data you enter into the app.

We do not collect:

Cookies or tracking data

The app functions entirely offline, and all data stays on your device.

Services you create (name, price)

Revenue and report data

App settings such as theme, language, and reminder preferences

You control all data.

3. Data Export & Import

Profit Tracker automatically saves and stores your data in JSON format on your device. 
These files can be used for backup or transferring your data to another device. 
We do not access, collect, or transmit these files in any way.

4. Notifications

The app may send optional appointment reminders if you enable notifications.
These reminders are generated locally on your device.
No notification data is sent to any external server.

5. Third-Party Services

Profit Tracker does not use:

Third-party analytics

Advertising networks

Cloud storage

External databases

Social logins

The app is fully independent and self-contained.

6. Children’s Privacy

Profit Tracker does not target or collect data from children.
Because no personal data is collected, the app is safe for all ages.

7. Security

Because all information is stored locally on your device, data security depends on your device’s own security measures.
We recommend keeping your device protected with a passcode, fingerprint, or similar method.

We may update this Privacy Policy as the app evolves.
Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated “Last Updated” date.
